# Pyber_analysis

# Overview
In this project, I created a summary of ride-sharing data between three city types (rural, urban and suburban). Using the data I was able to find the average fare by city type, and show how different city types compare in terms of ridesharing. What I am trying to find out in this analysis is which city type uses ridesharing services more. 

# Resources
Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
Software: Python 3.8.8, Anaconda 4.10.3

# Results
Based on the analysis, the urban cities use ride-sharing services the most. This is followed by suburban and rural cities. The results are not surprising, considering the fact that people who live in big cities usually do not own cars and rely on either public transport or ride-sharing services to get around. In suburban areas, majority of residents belong to families and they usually own at least one car. In this instance, it makes sense to see why many suburban residents would not have the need for a ride-share to move around. There are exceptions like going to the airport or if the person is unable to drive, another factor is some people use ride-sharing as a convenience. They might have a car in the house but would rather use a ride-share to get around sometimes (which is totally okay). The results are better seen in the line chart I made using pandas.

Breaking down the results, I have inserted a [table](https://github.com/somtoesomeju/Pyber_analysis/blob/main/Rideshare_data_by_city_type.png) from my analysis that contains the total number of rides, the total fares by city type and the average fares by city type. From the table, the results go back to what was explained above, urban city types rank first in all columns. The data from suburban cities are closer to rural cities than they are to urban cities. Rural cities, on the other hand, usually have people relying more on public transport than the other methods. This can be attributed to a lack of internet and credit cards.

# Summary
With regards to the differences in data between the city types, the main concern would be how to improve ride-sharing usage in rural and suburban areas. The main solution is patience, as with time both of these areas may catch up to the usage in urban cities. Better promotion and advertising in rural areas might encourage more people to opt for ridesharing services. In suburban areas, commericals that discourage drink-driving and promote calling for a ride are not only encouraging more people to try ride-sharing; they are also saving lives. With ever increasing car and gas prices, more people would likely ditch cars and opt for a ride-sharing service instead.
